Hello World!

I am Chandan Singh, a software developer by profession and a (proud) geek at
heart. I completed my graduation in Computer Science from
[Internation Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in)
in 2015. I enjoy solving puzzles and tackling hard problems. I like to make and
break stuff, though not always in that order. Besides that, I'm passionate
about almost everything related to Unix, Software Development and the Interweb!

I am a strong supporter of Open Source. I'm a
[Core Contributor](https://www.drupal.org/u/cs_shadow) to
[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) and several Drupal modules. I've also
contributed to a few other open source projects such as
[Learning Equality](https://learningequality.org). I also work with
[Google Open Source Programs Ofiice](https://www.google-melange.com) to support
FOSS via programs like
[Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) and
[Google Code-In](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/). I was a GSoC
2014 student and now I'm GSoC and GCI mentor for Drupal. I also get to
contribute to some Open Source projects as part of my job as a software
developer at [Bloomberg](http://bloomberg.com), which is pretty amazing.

Oh, did I mention that I'm a huge Sci-Fi fan - **Han shot first**. I'm also a
self-proclaimed Music connoisseur.

I disagree with the popular saying that there are only
[two hard problems in Computer Science](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html):
cache invalidation and naming things. I firmly believe that at least one of
the two things should be asking a programmer to answer the question :
*Tell me something about yourself* and that's why this *About* page is not in
the best of the conditions. And while we are at the subject of programmers,
this article on
[Real Programmers](http://web.mit.edu/humor/Computers/real.programmers) is one
of my favorites.

**May the Force be with you!**
