GSoC 2014 is over and it was a great summer for me. As a student, I lead the development of [Entity Embed](http://drupal.org/project/entity_embed) module for Drupal 8. I learnt a lot about Drupal 8 and the core values of Drupal community. Apart from working on my project, I also got involved with the Media Team and now I'm also trying to contribute to some of the other projects of the Drupal 8 Media initiative. It's been a fun journey with Drupal so far and I expect it to become even better.

To top it all off, I've been selected as a delegate to represent Drupal at the [GSoC Reunion summit](https://sites.google.com/site/gsocmentorsummitstudentreunion/home). Details at the [original post on gdo](https://groups.drupal.org/node/442513). I'm absolutely delighted that I've been selected as one of the delegates given the fact that Drupal os such a big community. What makes it even better is the fact that Angie Byron, ([webchick](http://webchick.net/about)) will be accompanying me at the summit as she's the other delegate. Its going to be a great chance for me to meet her in person.

I'm all set for the summit. Visa approved, flight & hotel booked. I'm eagerly waiting for this summit and I'm extremely thankful to the Drupal community for providing me with this wonderful opportunity.
