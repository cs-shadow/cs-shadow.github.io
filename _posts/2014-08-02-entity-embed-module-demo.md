<p>Midterm evaluations for GSoC are over and I've released a short demo for the entity embed module: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T26oz9H-VBY">Introducing Entity Embed module for Drupal 8</a>. This screencast explains the basic idea behind the module and its usage.</p>
<p>It's also time for the status update of what I've been doing for past couple of weeks. Apart from making the demo, a significant amount of work has been done since my last blog post. Some important issues that were solved over past couple of weeks include a much better test coverage, adding a preview of entity in CKEditor, adding support for alignment of embeds, and some code cleanup. Also, travis-ci is now enabled for the github repo so it has become far much easier to run tests on new pull requests and commits.</p>
<p>Check out the video and if you have any issues, feel free to open a ticket on the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/entity_embed">entity embed&nbsp;issue queue on d.o</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://chandansingh.net/contact">contact me directly</a>.</p>
