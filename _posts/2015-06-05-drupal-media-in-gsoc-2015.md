<h1>Drupal Media in GSoC 2015</h1><p></p><p><a href='http://www.drupalmedia.org/'>Drupal Media</a> has benefited from Google Summer of Code in the past. Last year one project under Drupal was directly a part of the Media Initiative - <a href='https://www.drupal.org/project/entity_embed'>Entity Embed</a> module for Drupal 8. I was that lucky student who got this wonderful opportunity to work under the mentorship of Media Initiative leads - Dave Reid (<a href='https://www.drupal.org/u/dave-reid'>davereid</a>) and Janez Urevc (<a href='https://www.drupal.org/u/slashrsm'>slashrsm</a>) but that&rsquo;s a story from the past and you can read more about it in <a href='http://chandansingh.net/blog/entity-embed-module-demo'>this blog post</a>. In this post I&rsquo;ll talk about the participation of Drupal Media in GSoC 2015.</p><p></p><p><h2>3 Projects from Drupal Media, woot!</h2></p><p></p><p>This year is turning out to be a great one for the Media Initiative in Google Summer of Code. We proposed three projects this year - all for Drupal 8 - and all of those were accepted and we managed to get three outstanding students. We take pride in telling everyone that not only all three students are Core contributors, they have also contributed to one or more Media modules already.</p><p></p><p>Now I would like to introduce the three students:</p><p></p><ul><li><b>Jayesh Solanki (<a href='https://www.drupal.org/u/jayeshsolanki'>jayeshsolanki</a>)</b>. Jayesh is a GSoC 2014 alumnus and last year he successfully ported <a href='https://www.drupal.org/project/disqus'>Disqus</a> module to Drupal 8. This year, he will be assisting with the development of <a href='http://drupal.org/project/issues/entity_browser'>Entity Browser</a>. Entity browser is a module for Drupal 8 that tries to provide&nbsp; powerful and flexible framework for searching &amp; selecting of&nbsp; entities. If you want to follow the development of this module or project, all the development will be happening in this <a href='https://github.com/drupal-media/entity_browser'>Github repository</a>. Janez Urevc (<a href='https://www.drupal.org/u/slashrsm'>slashrsm</a>) will be mentoring this project.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Prateek Mehta (<a href='https://www.drupal.org/u/prateekMehta/'>prateekMehta</a>)</b>. Prateek will be working on developing URL embed module for Drupal 8. This project aims to build a framework for CKEditor which would allow an end-user to&nbsp; display an embedded representation of a URL, the content of the URL can&nbsp; be a video, images, rich text or a link. This framework will handle URLs&nbsp; from various third party sites and essentially replace <a href='https://www.drupal.org/project/oEmbed'>oEmbed</a> module&nbsp; from Drupal 7. For more details, refer to this <a href='https://drupalmedia.hackpad.com/URL-Embed-Module-twIqPhOdp7P'>architecture discussion</a>. Currently, the development is happening in this <a href='https://github.com/prateekmehta/url_embed'>Github repository</a> but this will change soon when we get a new namespace on Drupal.org (don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll keep you posted). Dave Reid (<a href='https://www.drupal.org/u/dave-reid'>davereid</a>) and I will be mentoring this project.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Yuvraj Singh (<a href='https://www.drupal.org/u/root_brute'>root_brute</a>)</b>. Yuvraj will be working on develop <a href='https://www.drupal.org/project/embed'>Embed</a> module for Drupal 8 which will be an API level module. The idea of this project is to abstract&nbsp; the buttons, embed form, and display plugins from <a href='https://www.drupal.org/project/entity_embed'>Entity Embed</a> module into a&nbsp; generic Embed module that can be used by both Entity Embed, URL Embed,&nbsp; and other embeddables in Drupal 8. For more details, refer to this <a href='https://drupalmedia.hackpad.com/Embed-module-71ubAT132P3'>architecture discussion</a>.&nbsp; If you want to follow the development of this module or project, all the development will be happening in this <a href='https://github.com/drupal-media/embed'>Github repository</a>. Dave Reid (<a href='https://www.drupal.org/u/dave-reid'>davereid</a>) and I will be mentoring this project.</li></ul>

<p>We have high hopes from all these three projects and hope that all of these will finish successfully on schedule and I&rsquo;m very happy to tell you that all the signs are pretty good so far.</p><p></p><p>Looking forward to an exciting summer of code.</p>
