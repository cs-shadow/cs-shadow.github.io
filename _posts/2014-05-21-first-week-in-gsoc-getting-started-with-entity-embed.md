<p>Its roughly been a week since I've been working on <a href="https://drupal.org/project/entity_embed">Entity Embed</a> module and about time I provide some updates. We're off to a good start since the module is already functional. Though it still lacks a UI but its working fine in terms of embedding entities through text format. There's a still a lot of work to do including better error handling and providing test coverage apart from the UI but nevertheless, its a pretty decent start in my opinion.</p>
<p>I was lucky that I didn't had to start from scratch thanks to <a href="https://drupal.org/user/53892">Dave Reid</a>. For the UI part, we're planning to use <a href="https://drupal.org/project/entity_browser">Entity Browser</a>&nbsp;module which is also part of Drupal Media Initiative. Also, this module is recieving good support by community. Today itself, <a href="https://drupal.org/user/254778">webflo</a> provided link to a similar module which he integrated with current Entity Embed module. This links has further details:&nbsp;https://drupal.org/node/2271567.</p>
<p>If you have any ideas/suggestions feel free to contact me.</p>
