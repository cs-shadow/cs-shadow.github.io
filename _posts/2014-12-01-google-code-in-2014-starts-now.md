Google Code-In (GCI) just started. For those of you who are not aware of this program, its a contest where students (ages 13-17) work on tasks for Drupal (and other open source open source organizations).

In case you want to get involved with GCI, join `#drupal-google` on Freenode and we'll help you out after that. If you're a high school student of age 13-17, lots of interesting tasks await you at Drupal (http://www.google-melange.com/gci/org/google/gci2014/drupal). If you want to sign up as a mentor, register at http://www.google-melange.com/gci/homepage/google/gci2014 and request Mentor role from Drupal.
