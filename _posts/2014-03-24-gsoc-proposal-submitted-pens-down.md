<p>Proposal submitted for GSoC, pens down (at least for now!). I submitted proposal for 'WYSIWYG Inline entity' to <a href="https://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>. With a list that contained more than 10 organizations at a time but in the end I just shortlisted Drupal. Fingers crossed, wating for 21st April when Google will announce the result.</p>
<p>A link to the proposal i submitted:&nbsp;<a href="http://web.iiit.ac.in/~chandan.singh/GSoC14-DrupalProposal-WYSIWYG_Inline_entity.pdf">web.iiit.ac.in/~chandan.singh/GSoC14-DrupalProposal-WYSIWYG_Inline_entity.pdf</a></p>
